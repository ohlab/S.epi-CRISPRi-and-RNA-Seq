Tiling Guides Guide Design Script 

This script demonstrates how we designed guides for our study. Included in this 
folder is the input file ("Tu3298_whole_genome_singleseq.fasta"). 

Expected output is the list of guides we used in our study. 

We are providing this code to demonstrate how our guides were created, but it 
may be useful for your own CRISPRi experiments. In these cases, you can expect that you 
may have to adjust the code to work with your own input file. 

Dependencies: 
Biostrings (2.54.0)
stringr (1.4.0)

R installation required to run. Tested on R version 3.6.2 Expected run time: 15 minutes
